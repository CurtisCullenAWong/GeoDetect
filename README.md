# GeoDetect 
## Smart Location Analysis (Powered by Flutter)

![GeoDetect Logo](logo.png) 

GeoDetect is a cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter** that provides an in-depth, structured analysis of a user's current geographical coordinates. Leveraging native location services and reverse-geocoding, the app transforms raw latitude and longitude data into comprehensive, human-readable address components and actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Positioning:** Uses the `geolocator` package to accurately fetch the user's current GPS location.
* **Precise Geocoding:** Utilizes the `geocoding` package to convert coordinates into detailed address objects (Placemarks).
* **Component Breakdown:** Clearly presents the address by breaking it down into individual components (Street, Locality, Postal Code, Country, etc.).
* **Intuitive UI:** A clean, modern user interface built with Flutter widgets for a smooth experience on both iOS and Android.
* **Permission Handling:** Robust logic to check and request necessary location permissions.
